# APIDesignInObjectOriented

We all can write code but how confident we are about it? When should we use composite pattern? and when should not use Singleton pattern? what is different between composite vs decorator pattern? when to apply which pattern? is pattern a mandatory? do we apply right object oriented principles? 

Basically, you never know! there is always a better code than yours (I feel).

So started this mini project where I collect different API requirements (available online) and try to come up with best low level design / code.
